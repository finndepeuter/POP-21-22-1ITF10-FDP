## MedicationCheckApp
A lot of people that have to take medication, sometimes forget to take it. 
That's where this app comes into place. You get the question if you have taken your meds and can click yes or no. No additional features yet.
## pages overview
- 0.kv is the homepage of the app
- 1.kv is the first page that asks the question if you have taken your medication.
- 2.kv is the page if you select yes.
- 3.kv is the page if you select no.
- main.py is the controller of the program that runs it.

> the app is made with [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) and afterwards built with [Buildozer](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
